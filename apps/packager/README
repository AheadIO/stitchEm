1. Introduction
---------------

Thank you for choosing VideoStitch Studio, the missing tool for high resolution
panoramic video! This file aims to help you understand how to install, use,
and get the most enjoyment from this software.


2. Conditions of use
--------------------

Please ensure you have read and agreed with the EULA file content present
in this directory.


3. How to install
-----------------

Please ensure you have these libraries installed on your system (they may
have different names depending on your system):
- The nVidia proprietary driver and the latest CUDA 6.5 runtime:
  http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx
  VideoStitch won't work with any other drivers, including the "Nouveau"
  open-source driver.
- Qt >= 5.3.0 (libQt5Core, libQt5Gui, libQt5Widgets, libQt5OpenGL, libQt5DBus)
- freetype 6 (libfreetype6)
- Xcb (libx11-xcb1)
- Xdmcp (libxdmcp6)

That's all!


4. How to use
-------------

Unzip the .zip into the folder of your choice (it already contains a
videostitch/ folder).

This folder now contains the videostitch tools:
- videostitch-studio is the graphical interface for VideoStitch. It gathers many
  steps and information from your workflow in an intuitive way.
- videostitch-cmd is the command-line version of our stitcher engine.
- 'calibrationimport' is a .pts (PTGui) or .pto (PTGui) file converter to the
  VideoStitch PTV format.

See the documentation for more detailed explanations and examples!
