# OS X 10.11.5 / Xcode 8 Beta: unlock of an unlocked mutex
# in system library libGPUSupportMercury.dylib
# when calling clCreateCommandQueue from main thread
#
# See confluence "OpenCL driver bugs" for complete example
mutex:gldCreateQueue
# Race condition reported in std::future in ReaderController::seekFrame
# It seems the std::future implementation of libc++ first checks a non-atomic
# state to throw an exception, which is later set (written with a lock)
#
# I believe the race (benign or not) is in libc++ and our usage
# of std::async is correct
race:__assoc_state<VideoStitch::Status>::set_value
